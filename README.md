# bunfetch-plugin

This is just some cute plug-in for handling response 

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

I not publishing it cuz it's just a fancy way to use bun fetch 
this shit just reflection of my skill issues this plug in not fully optimize so you might encounter tremendous amount of bugs 💔 and I ain't gonna fix them 

```javacript
console.log("fix the bugs 🐛 and don't forget to push it here see yaa ")
```

or you can just copy some of the plug in and implement them 💔 i would be happy 😁 but I know 😙 i am ruining your time whatever I am bored too
